## CS 526: Data Structures and Algorithms
`This course covers and relates fundamental components of programs. 
Students use various data structures to solve computational problems, and implement data structures using a high-level programming language. 
Algorithms are created, decomposed, and expressed as pseudocode. 
The running time of various algorithms and their computational complexity are analyzed. `

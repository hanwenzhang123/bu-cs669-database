max and min
AS - naming that colomn for the result
MAX() AS __, MIN() AS __


Grouping - group by the value
- aggregate function
group them then run by group

Do the from and group by first 


HAVING limites the results of aggregating data
WHERE only works rows by rows

Grouping first then filter down by the HAVING


Order of operation summary

Normalization

A functional dependency as A->B
Once you have A, You can figure out B, A determines B

What column determines what column

if you know date, then you know todays topics

once you know the photographer id then you know the name
once you know date and tripod tag name then you know tripod model


we must identify all candidate key

partial dependency
AB - CD
B - C

2NF and 3NF

know how to explain BCNF

every determinant must be a candidate key
